# Task for reviewer

Re-review Task 4 after the fix. Read brief /home/lutrarutra/dev/codepi/.superpowers/sdd/task-4-brief.md, updated report /home/lutrarutra/dev/codepi/.superpowers/sdd/task-4-report.md, and complete diff package /home/lutrarutra/dev/codepi/.superpowers/sdd/review-3e20104..38405e7.diff. Review read-only. Verify the theme override now survives DefaultResourceLoader.reload(), explicit user theme wins, no persistence occurs, normal user resources/bundled filtering/extension ordering/shared SettingsManager/canonical roots remain correct, and no new important defects exist. Legacy import prompt is deferred to Task 7. Do not run broad suites or mutate files. Return required verdict, strengths, remaining issues by severity, and Task quality verdict. Do not create subagents.

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: /home/lutrarutra/dev/codepi/.superpowers/sdd/task-4-rereview.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
